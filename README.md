### PHP script to export Gallery2 photos to Picasa Web Albums  

This PHP script will retrieve albums from your Gallery2 installation and post the albums, photos and captions to your Picasa Web Albums account.  The script can be set to upload the entire gallery or a specific album.  It can also be set to ignore specific albums.  Note that Picasa does not support sub-albums (nested albums).  Therefore this script will upload sub-albums from Gallery2 as top-level albums in Picasa Web Albums.
